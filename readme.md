# ✋ Sign Language Alphabet Translator (Java + DSA)

### 🎯 Goal
Translates typed English words into sign language alphabet images.

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. User types a word (e.g., CAT)
2. Program shows sign images for C, A, and T sequentially.
3. Uses HashMap for instant lookup, LinkedList for ordered display.

### 🧠 Data Structures Used
- HashMap → Letter to image mapping (O(1) lookup)
- LinkedList → Maintain order of image display
- Queue → Store recent translations
- File Handling → Save mappings persistently

### 🚀 Run Instructions
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SignLanguageTranslator.git
